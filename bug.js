```javascript
//Some Tailwind directives might not work as expected due to incorrect configuration or missing plugins.
//For example, using a plugin's directive without installing or configuring it properly.

//Example of an incorrect configuration leading to unexpected behavior:
//Let's imagine a custom plugin that adds the directive `@apply` for typography styles. Without properly installing and configuring the plugin, `@apply` won't be recognized.

//Missing or Incorrect Configuration file:
/*tailwind.config.js*/
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [], // Missing the plugin here
};

//CSS file with custom directives:
/*index.css*/
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.typography {
  @apply text-lg font-bold;
}
